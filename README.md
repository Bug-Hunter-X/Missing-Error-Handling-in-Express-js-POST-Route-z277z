# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in request processing.  The `/users` route in `bug.js` attempts to create a user, but it lacks robust checks for malformed requests or database errors, leading to potential crashes or inconsistent behavior.

`bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

**Key improvements in `bugSolution.js`:**

* **Input validation:** Checks if `req.body` is present and contains all necessary fields.
* **Database error handling:** Uses `try...catch` blocks for more reliable error handling. 
* **HTTP status codes:** Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) to indicate error conditions.
* **Detailed error messages:** Provides more informative error messages to clients and logs to aid debugging.
